# Overview

:::info
**Summary:**
:::

- The rise of artificial intelligence is driving a fundamental split in data center design, creating a distinct class of AI-focused facilities optimized for computationally intensive workloads like model training and inference.
- Traditional data centers prioritize reliability and cost-efficiency for diverse, unpredictable tasks using standard CPUs, DDR memory, Ethernet networking, and air cooling within moderate power densities (5-20 kW/rack).
- AI data centers are engineered for sustained, peak performance on massively parallel tasks, demanding specialized accelerators (GPUs, TPUs), high-bandwidth memory (HBM), ultra-fast interconnects (InfiniBand/RoCE), and extreme power densities (40-120kW+ per rack), necessitating advanced liquid cooling solutions.
- This divergence stems from the unique power-hungry and communication-intensive nature of AI workloads, influencing everything from physical layout and power infrastructure to site selection prioritizing massive power availability.
- The split extends to operations, economics, and security:
  - **Operations:** AI facilities require specialized monitoring, AIOps, and system-level fault tolerance beyond simple redundancy.
  - **Security:** Unique AI risks (data poisoning, model theft) demand protection across the entire MLOps lifecycle.
  - **Economics:** AI CapEx is dominated by accelerators and networking; OpEx by massive power consumption, making energy efficiency and sourcing critical.
- Hyperscalers invest heavily in large-scale AI capacity, but public cloud, private builds, colocation, and edge AI deployments all play key roles.
