**Networking Technology Comparison**

The choice of networking fabric is a critical differentiator. This table compares the key technologies:

| Technology | Key Characteristics | Primary Use Case (AI DC) | Pros | Cons | Sources |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Standard Ethernet (\<=100G)** | Ubiquitous, best-effort delivery, mature ecosystem, lower speeds | Frontend network, management, traditional workloads | Cost-effective, widely understood, interoperable | High latency, not lossless (unsuitable for RDMA/AI collectives without significant modification) | 1 |
| **InfiniBand (IB)** | High bandwidth (400G/800G+), low latency, lossless fabric, native RDMA support | AI training backend fabric (Scale-Out) | Proven performance for HPC/AI, efficient RDMA, mature ecosystem for HPC | Potential scaling limits, higher cost, vendor concentration (NVIDIA/Mellanox), separate network | 23 |
| **Ethernet with RoCE (e.g., Spectrum-X)** | High bandwidth (400G/800G+), RDMA over Ethernet, requires lossless configuration (PFC/ECN) | AI training/inference backend fabric (Scale-Out) | Leverages Ethernet ecosystem, potential cost savings, supplier diversity, better integration potential | Requires careful configuration for losslessness, performance potentially sensitive to network tuning | 54 |
| **Scale-Up Fabric (NVLink/ICI/NeuronLink)** | Extremely high bandwidth (TB/s aggregate), ultra-low latency, proprietary, short reach | Intra-server/intra-node accelerator interconnect (Scale-Up) | Enables fine-grained parallelism (e.g., tensor parallelism), maximizes accelerator utilization | Proprietary, limited distance, adds complexity/cost | 23 |

The pronounced hardware specialization within AI data centers fosters a much tighter coupling between key components—accelerator, memory, and interconnect—compared to the more modular nature of traditional servers. While traditional server configurations often allow for flexible mixing and matching of CPUs, DRAM modules, NICs, and storage devices based on general compatibility 14, the performance of an AI server is critically dependent on the balanced throughput of its entire data path. Bottlenecks in feeding data from high-bandwidth memory (HBM) to the accelerator, or in communicating results between accelerators via high-speed fabrics like NVLink or InfiniBand/RoCE, can severely limit overall performance, leaving expensive compute units underutilized.23 Consequently, AI server design increasingly emphasizes system-level optimization and co-design. Platforms like NVIDIA's DGX systems, Google's TPU pods, and AWS's Trainium-based servers are conceived as integrated units where the choice and integration of accelerators, HBM, scale-up interconnects (like NVLink, ICI, or NeuronLink 47), and scale-out networking interfaces are highly interdependent and optimized for specific AI workloads.42 This contrasts sharply with the component-level modularity often seen in the traditional server market.

This shift in hardware focus from general-purpose CPUs to specialized, high-cost accelerators dramatically reshapes the value chain and economics of the data center market. Traditional server BOMs typically show CPUs and DRAM accounting for a large percentage of the total cost.42 However, in high-end AI servers like the NVIDIA DGX H100, the accelerators themselves dominate the cost structure, with system DRAM, despite potentially large capacities, representing a much smaller fraction (under 5% excluding HBM).42 NVIDIA's substantial gross margins on these systems underscore the significant value captured by accelerator vendors.42 This trend implies a relative decline in the market share or value allocated to traditional CPU vendors and standard DRAM suppliers within the rapidly expanding AI data center segment. Conversely, suppliers of critical enabling technologies like HBM and high-speed interconnect components gain significant importance in the AI hardware ecosystem.42

The ongoing competition between InfiniBand and high-speed Ethernet (using RoCE) for the AI backend network fabric reflects a classic technological and market standards battle. InfiniBand gained early traction in HPC and AI due to its inherent low-latency, lossless design, and efficient RDMA implementation, offering proven performance for tightly coupled, communication-intensive workloads.55 Ethernet, benefiting from its ubiquity, vast ecosystem, and potentially lower cost base, presents a compelling alternative, particularly for hyperscalers managing enormous, heterogeneous network environments.55 These large operators strongly desire supplier diversity to avoid vendor lock-in and are concerned about the scalability and management of InfiniBand across tens or hundreds of thousands of nodes.55 Consequently, significant effort has been invested in enhancing Ethernet with features like PFC and ECN to enable reliable RoCE performance, aiming to close the gap with InfiniBand.54 This competition drives innovation in both technologies and provides customers with more choices, forcing vendors to compete on performance, cost, scalability, and ease of management for large-scale AI deployments.55
