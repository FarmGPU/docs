# Roadmap

FarmGPU is committed to expanding its reach, capabilities, and technology integrations, as detailed in our future roadmap.

## Future Developments
Our roadmap focuses on expanding GPU offerings and integrating seamlessly with more Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePIN). In particular, we aim to extend our GPU rental capabilities by adding more geographically distributed nodes and embracing diverse energy sources, including renewable power. We also plan to enrich our GPU rental platform by providing more specific hardware configurations for diverse AI workloads and further enhance our liquid cooling and sustainability practices to ensure scalability at minimal environmental cost.

## Milestones
Key milestones that define our growth trajectory include:

- **Tokenized NFT Launch**: FarmGPU will launch tokenized NFTs representing GPU assets, allowing fractional ownership for investors, thereby democratizing access to GPU compute.
- **Integration with DePIN Platforms**: We will broaden our partnerships by integrating additional DePIN platforms to support decentralized compute resources, creating more accessible infrastructure for AI developers. We are working with RunPod, vast.ai, Akash, Spheron to expand the offerings.
