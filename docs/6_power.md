**Power**

The most distinctive physical characteristic of AI data centers is their extraordinary power density and corresponding cooling requirements, which dramatically exceed those of traditional facilities. These differences drive fundamental changes in physical infrastructure design and operational approaches.

**A. Power Density Comparison**

Traditional enterprise data centers typically operate at power densities between 4-15 kW per rack, with an average around 7 kW.34 Even high-performance computing facilities rarely exceed 30 kW per rack.35 The power distribution infrastructure in these environments is designed accordingly, with typical power distribution units (PDUs) and branch circuits sized for these relatively modest demands.36

In contrast, AI training clusters routinely operate at 40-100 kW per rack, with leading-edge deployments reaching or exceeding 150 kW per rack.37 This represents a 10-20x increase in power density compared to traditional enterprise environments. These extreme densities are driven by the power demands of accelerator-heavy architectures:38

* A single NVIDIA H100 GPU has a maximum thermal design power (TDP) of 700 watts39
* A typical AI server with 8 H100 GPUs can draw 8-10 kW during operation40
* A 42U rack filled with these servers can exceed 100 kW total power draw41

These extreme densities create several challenges not commonly faced in traditional environments:

* **Power Distribution:** Standard power distribution equipment is inadequate for these loads. AI data centers require specialized high-capacity busways, custom power distribution units, and dense three-phase power solutions.42
* **Circuit Capacity:** The number of high-amperage circuits required per square foot of data center space is much higher, necessitating denser electrical distribution systems.43
* **Peak Load Management:** The collective power draw from hundreds or thousands of GPUs starting workloads simultaneously can create demand spikes that require specialized power management approaches.44
* **Backup Power Scaling:** Providing UPS and generator backup for multi-megawatt AI clusters requires different approaches than traditional environments, often including dedicated power plants or specialized agreements with utility providers.
