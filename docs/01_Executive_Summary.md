# Executive Summary

FarmGPU is redefining the future of GPU-powered cloud computing by offering cost-effective, scalable, and high-performance GPU resources tailored specifically for AI developers, innovative startups, and enterprises worldwide. The FarmGPU Cloud Platform that consists of

**AI Data Center Blueprint**: We transform small to medium traditional data centers (5–20MW) into AI-ready facilities optimized for GPUs and accelerators. Features include high-power racks (45–130+ kW), 800G InfiniBand/ethernet with RDMA, and liquid/immersion cooling for maximized performance and energy efficiency.

**On-demand Compute Platform**: Deliver containers, VMs, and cloud-native workloads with GPUs in seconds, pay as you go, and access to powerful and cost effective GPU selection – up to **70% lower cost than AWS and Azure**. This is available on the RunPod Secure Cloud platform (US-CA-2).

**Storage for AI**: Accelerate storage intensive training workloads with GPU-direct storage enabled for higher bandwidth from NVMe. Use of NVIDIA BlueField 3 DPUs offload CPU tasks for encryption, compression, and data protection to reduce TCO. Inference with native vectorDB integration allows enterprises to deploy private AI with access to company knowledge.

We are pioneering a **Tokenized GPU** marketplace in partnership with Silicon Network, democratizing access to AI computing by tokenizing physical GPUs into NFTs, connecting owners, providers/data center operator, and customers.

Finally, we deploy immersion cooled micro edge data centers with Aero Edge, custom inference optimized design deployed at edge locations for sustainable operations leveraging heat reuse to deliver reduced operational costs.
