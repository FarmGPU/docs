**Summary:**

The rise of artificial intelligence is driving a fundamental split in data center design, creating a distinct class of AI-focused facilities optimized for computationally intensive workloads like model training and inference, contrasting sharply with traditional data centers built for general-purpose applications. Traditional centers prioritize reliability and cost-efficiency across diverse, often unpredictable tasks using standard CPUs, DDR memory, Ethernet networking, and air cooling within moderate power densities (5-20 kW/rack). Conversely, AI data centers are engineered for sustained, peak performance on massively parallel tasks, demanding specialized accelerators (GPUs, TPUs), high-bandwidth memory (HBM), ultra-fast interconnects (InfiniBand/RoCE), and extreme power densities (40-120kW+ per rack), necessitating advanced liquid cooling solutions. This divergence stems directly from the unique power-hungry and communication-intensive nature of AI workloads, influencing everything from physical layout and power infrastructure to site selection prioritizing massive power availability.

This infrastructure bifurcation extends to operations, economics, and security. AI facilities require specialized monitoring (tracking accelerator performance), leverage AIOps for managing complexity, and demand system-level fault tolerance due to the scale and interconnectedness of hardware, moving beyond simple redundancy. Security concerns expand to include unique AI risks like data poisoning and model theft, demanding protection across the entire MLOps lifecycle. Economically, AI data center CapEx is dominated by expensive accelerators and high-speed networking, while massive power consumption drives OpEx, making energy efficiency and sourcing critical. While hyperscalers heavily invest in building large-scale AI capacity, leveraging public cloud remains a key deployment model, alongside private builds, colocation, and emerging edge AI deployments addressing latency and privacy needs.
