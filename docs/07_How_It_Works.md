# Tokenized GPUs

FarmGPU leverages Silicon Network's decentralized tokenization platform to represent physical GPUs as digital assets (NFTs), unlocking transparent ownership, fractional investment, and on-chain revenue sharing.

## GPU Tokenization Platform
Silicon Network bridges physical GPU infrastructure and blockchain-based ownership via a dual-chain architecture:

- Base Chain (Ethereum L2): Handles capital formation and initial NFT minting.
- Chia Blockchain: Serves as the secure registry for GPU ownership, performance metrics, and earnings distribution.

Each physical GPU in FarmGPU's data centers is minted as an NFT with immutable metadata (hardware specs, datacenter location, and performance history). Token holders can verify provenance on-chain and trade or fractionalize their GPU assets in a liquid secondary marketplace.

## GPU Marketplace and Trading
FarmGPU GPUs are listed on Silicon Network's GPU Marketplace, enabling both primary issuance and secondary trading:

- **Primary Market**: Investors purchase newly minted GPU NFTs to fund new deployments.
- **Secondary Market**: NFT holders buy, sell, or trade existing GPU assets, with transparent price discovery and fractional ownership options.

## Datacenter Infrastructure & Management
FarmGPU integrates with Silicon Network's Datacenter Management Platform to automate:

- Asset tracking and performance monitoring
- Firmware and driver updates
- Automated revenue distribution to GPU NFT holders

This ensures each GPU node operates at peak efficiency while providing real-time utilization data on-chain.

## Revenue Sharing Model
Silicon Network's smart contracts handle earnings distribution based on GPU utilization:

1. Customers burn $SIL tokens to purchase compute credits (DC).
2. Compute credits are consumed by FarmGPU GPUs for training and inference.
3. At the end of each epoch, smart contracts mint new $SIL tokens proportional to consumed credits and distribute them to NFT holders and datacenter operators.

This transparent, on-chain revenue-sharing model delivers passive income to GPU owners and aligns incentives across the ecosystem.

## Getting Started
1. Browse available GPU NFTs on the Silicon Network Marketplace.
2. Purchase or fractionalize a GPU NFT to claim ownership.
3. Earn rewards automatically as FarmGPU deploys and operates your GPU in an enterprise-grade data center.
