# How It Works

FarmGPU is setup as a traditional cloud hosting partner and provider, but also has a new unique ownership platform with the partnership with Berkeley Compute.

## Customer Investment in FarmGPU GPUs
Customers invest directly in FarmGPU GPUs, which are hosted and managed by FarmGPU in our data centers. Each GPU is represented by a Non-Fungible Token (NFT), providing a transparent and secure record of ownership on the blockchain. This model allows customers to invest in GPU infrastructure without the need to manage the technical complexities.

## Hosting and Management
FarmGPU takes care of all aspects of GPU hosting, from setup and maintenance to optimization for AI workloads. FarmGPU pays for all operational expenditures like data center space, power, cooling, and networking.

## Revenue Sharing via Berkeley Compute
Payouts are facilitated through the Berkeley Compute platform, utilizing a unique revenue-sharing model that is fully transparent on the blockchain. This approach ensures that all revenue generated from GPU utilization is distributed fairly among GPU owners, providing them with a reliable passive income stream while maintaining transparency.

**Financial model:** FarmGPU hosts the GPUs with partners and through direct listings and long term agreements, and shares revenue with the GPU owner. Target: 30% IRR and 26 month payback on initial capex. You can see the full transparent version of our financial model on the FarmGPU website.
