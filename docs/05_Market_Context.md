## Hyperscaler Dominance

Major cloud service providers like Google, Meta, and Microsoft dominate the AI compute infrastructure space. Their significant investments have enabled them to maintain a stronghold on the market, but their high costs, vendor lock-ins, and limited availability restrict accessibility for many users. This dominance has created a market that caters primarily to large enterprises, leaving startups, researchers, and smaller businesses searching for more viable alternatives.

## The Rise of VC-Backed Startups and Researchers

AI startups backed by venture capital are driving much of the innovation in the space. These companies, alongside independent researchers, need GPU resources for AI training and inferencing tasks, but they are often constrained by budget limitations. Accessing flexible, affordable compute resources is essential for these groups to develop new AI solutions and bring them to market quickly.

## Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePIN)

The rise of DePIN represents a shift towards a more open and democratized compute market. By leveraging decentralized principles, DePIN enables a distributed approach to GPU infrastructure, which significantly reduces costs, eliminates vendor lock-ins, and increases accessibility. DePIN also supports tokenization, which allows for fractional ownership and opens up investment opportunities in GPU resources, attracting new participants to the market.

## Edge Computing and On-Demand GPU Platforms

On-demand GPU platforms are gaining popularity as they offer a viable alternative to traditional cloud providers. These platforms, often supported by smaller data centers and individual GPU owners, can deliver high-performance computing resources without the bureaucracy and high costs of hyperscalers. By leveraging consumer-grade GPUs, these platforms maintain a cost advantage, providing accessible compute solutions for AI inferencing and experimentation.

## Competition

While large hyperscalers remain dominant, a new class of Neocloud providers, like FarmGPU, has emerged to offer leaner, more specialized, and cost-optimized solutions tailored for AI workloads. Semi-analysis suggests they could make up almost 50% of the AI compute market. This section outlines the competitive landscape and highlights FarmGPU's unique advantages as a Neocloud provider.

### Traditional Hyperscalers

**Examples:** AWS, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure

These major cloud service providers offer a broad range of globally distributed services, including sophisticated GPU offerings. However, they often present significant drawbacks for AI/ML teams:

- **High Costs:** On-demand H100 instances on hyperscalers can be up to 6.5x more expensive than current market rates, making large-scale or long-duration training sessions prohibitively expensive.
- **Vendor Lock-In:** Complex, platform-specific solutions can make migrating workloads or switching providers a costly, technical challenge.
- **Limited Availability:** GPU quotas may fluctuate, creating resource bottlenecks and limiting experimentation or scaling for AI-driven initiatives.

### FarmGPU Differentiator

By focusing exclusively on GPU infrastructure for AI/ML, FarmGPU bypasses hyperscaler overhead, enabling pricing closer to true market rates. Our decentralized approach (via DePIN), combined with enterprise-grade data center standards, ensures reliable access to GPU resources without punitive vendor lock-in or unpredictable quotas.

### FarmGPU's Lean, GPU-Centric Model

FarmGPU delivers cost-effective, scalable, and high-performance GPU computing to AI developers, startups, and enterprises.

#### Cost Optimization

- **Hardware Customization:** FarmGPU curates its servers' Bill of Materials (BOM) specifically for AI workloads. For example, we may select mid-level CPUs and right-size RAM for specific AI inference or fine-tuning workloads. We build systems from L6 (barebones) with customized AI servers from MSI, Gigabyte, and Supermicro, performing the system integration in-house.
- **Networking Efficiency:** We use cost-effective Ethernet switches for front-end traffic and implement efficient backend topologies—akin to a "virtual modular switch"—to reduce reliance on pricey optical transceivers. We might adopt a 2:1 oversubscription model for smaller clusters to minimize the number of expensive spine switches.
- **Storage Optimization:** We include the latest PCIe 5.0 NVMe SSDs in our AI servers and deploy a high-speed storage fabric in partnership with leading AI storage software vendors. This is still offered at a fraction of the cost of durable SSD cloud storage (e.g., AWS EBS).
- **Software Savings:** By avoiding costly, generic software packages (e.g., Nvidia AI Enterprise, Base Command Manager) that add minimal value to our specialized service model, FarmGPU keeps overhead low and passes those savings on to customers.
