# Financial Model

Our model is simple: we are 100% transparent by putting our real-world utilization, telemetry, availability, and durability on the blockchain. We operate a lean operation in a tier 3 data center in Rancho Cordova, CA. The total cost of ownership for a GPU includes data center space, power, networking, cooling, license fees, and staffing.

We operate under a model where we host machines for GPU owners, operate them, and put them in our AI partner cloud. We share the revenue directly with the owner, typically 70/30 for high-end GPUs, through a standard operating agreement. We pay the opex, so there is no need for the GPU owner to ever think about a data center. Leave it up to the experts.
