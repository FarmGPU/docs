- **Flexible deployment**: Deploy your code using Serverless for autoscaling pay-per-second execution, or Pods for containerized GPU and CPU instances.
- **Command-line interface**: Use the RunPod command-line interface to seamlessly automate deployments.
- **Transparent pricing**: GPUs are billed by the minute, with no fees for ingress/egress.

### Serverless

Serverless offers pay-per-second serverless computing with built-in autoscaling for production workloads.

Use Serverless to:

- Deploy AI workloads with low cold-start times and robust security.
- Build and expose REST API endpoints with autoscaling.
- Queue jobs efficiently without managing infrastructure.

### Secure Cloud

- **Secure Cloud**: Operates in T3/T4 data centers, providing high reliability and security.
- **Community Cloud**: Connects individual compute providers to users through a vetted, secure peer-to-peer system.

- **Redundant Storage**: Separate RAID-protected boot arrays (&ge;500 GB, 2,000 MB/s) and working NVMe arrays (2&ndash;4 TB+ per GPU, 5,000&ndash;6,000 MB/s) with hundreds of thousands of IOPS.
- **Shared Storage Cluster**: &ge;200 TB raw across 4+ servers, 200 Gbps private data-plane network, and DDR5/ECC memory for consistent throughput.
- **Certified Software Stack**: Ubuntu 24.04 LTS with Linux kernel 6.5+, latest NVIDIA drivers and CUDA, HGX SXM monitoring tools.
- **Robust Power Infrastructure**: Dual utility feeds (substation-isolated), N+1 UPS & generators with &ge;15 min runtime, 2N rack-level PDUs, and automated transfer switches.
- **High-Availability Network**: Dual 100 Gbps internet circuits with BGP failover, redundant core/distribution/ToR switches, &lt;0.1% packet loss, and P95 latency/jitter within 4ms/3ms.
- **Compliance & Security**: SOC 2 Type I or ISO/IEC 27001 certification, Tier III+ data center standards, 24/7 on-site security, and audited physical access controls.

By adhering to these stringent specifications, FarmGPU delivers guaranteed uptime, predictable high throughput, and full complianceâ€”leveraging RunPod's secure cloud validation and ecosystem benefits.

## Silicon Network Partnership

[Silicon Network](https://www.silicon.net/), developed by Berkeley Compute, is a decentralized blockchain-enabled AI infrastructure platform that democratizes access to GPU computing resources through tokenization and a flexible marketplace. FarmGPU is a key launch partner and major Verified Provider within the Silicon Network ecosystem.

Through this partnership, FarmGPU integrates its high-performance GPU infrastructure with Silicon Network's innovative platform. This collaboration enables:

- **Tokenized GPU Ownership**: FarmGPU's GPUs are represented as Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) on the blockchain via Silicon Network's Tokenization Platform. This introduces fractional ownership and unlocks new investment opportunities in real-world compute infrastructure, allowing investors to hold, trade, and earn income from GPU resources.
- **Marketplace Access**: FarmGPU provides compute resources and tokenized GPUs to customers through Silicon Network's GPU Marketplace and Compute Marketplace, increasing the reach and utilization of FarmGPU's infrastructure.
- **Operational Efficiency**: FarmGPU leverages Silicon Network's Datacenter Infrastructure Management Platform for streamlined management of tokenized GPU assets, performance monitoring, and automated revenue distribution to NFT holders.
- **DePIN Ecosystem Participation**: The partnership firmly positions FarmGPU within the Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network (DePIN) ecosystem powered by Silicon Network, enhancing the value proposition for both GPU owners and users.

This collaboration is instrumental in creating a liquid market for AI infrastructure investment and providing customers with flexible, cost-efficient access to high-performance computing resources.

## Benefits of Strategic Partnerships

- **Secure and Reliable Cloud Hosting**: The partnership with RunPod ensures that FarmGPU's infrastructure is secure, scalable, and optimized for AI workloads, providing users with dependable compute resources.
- **Tokenized Ownership and Investment**: Collaboration with Silicon Network brings tokenized ownership to the GPU space, allowing individuals to invest in GPU clusters and earn passive income, while also enhancing liquidity through secondary markets facilitated by the Silicon Network platform.
- **Scalable Infrastructure**: Both partnerships enable FarmGPU to offer a scalable solution, supporting everything from small-scale experimental AI projects to large-scale model training and deployment.
- **Decentralized Compute Ecosystem**: Together with RunPod and Silicon Network, FarmGPU is building a decentralized compute ecosystem that fosters innovation, reduces dependency on centralized providers, and democratizes access to high-performance computing.

FarmGPU's partnerships with RunPod and Silicon Network position us as a leader in sustainable, decentralized, and high-performance AI infrastructure. These collaborations are instrumental in delivering the flexibility, cost efficiency, and innovation needed to empower the next generation of AI developers and researchers.
