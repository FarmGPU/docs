# Strategic Partnerships

FarmGPU's success is built on strategic partnerships that enhance our infrastructure, expand our capabilities, and provide seamless integration with existing technologies. Our key partnerships include RunPod and Berkeley Compute, which play a vital role in delivering secure, scalable, and decentralized AI computing solutions.

## RunPod Integration

RunPod is a crucial partner in enabling FarmGPU's secure cloud infrastructure. By integrating with RunPod's secure cloud platform, FarmGPU is able to offer GPU hosting that meets stringent reliability and compliance requirements. RunPod provides a robust platform for deploying and managing GPU clusters, with a focus on maintaining operational excellence and high standards for cloud security.

RunPod's infrastructure ensures that all deployed GPU clusters are fully optimized for hosting AI workloads, including deep learning model training and inferencing tasks. The compliance standards maintained by RunPod include minimum deployment sizes, secure cloud environments, and redundancy in power and network infrastructure. This partnership ensures that FarmGPU delivers industry-leading reliability and quality for GPU hosting.

## Berkeley Compute Tokenization

Berkeley Compute is an integral partner in implementing the tokenization of GPU clusters. Through this collaboration, FarmGPU enables GPUs to be represented as Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) on the blockchain, introducing a new level of ownership and liquidity to the GPU market. Berkeley Compute's technology allows GPU assets to be tokenized, making fractional ownership possible and unlocking the ability for investors to hold, trade, and earn income from GPU resources.

With Berkeley Compute, the tokenized GPU model creates opportunities for passive income, investment in real-world compute infrastructure, and participation in the decentralized AI economy. This partnership also allows FarmGPU to tap into the DePIN ecosystem, further enhancing the value proposition for GPU owners and users.

## Benefits of Strategic Partnerships

- **Secure and Reliable Cloud Hosting**: The partnership with RunPod ensures that FarmGPU's infrastructure is secure, scalable, and optimized for AI workloads, providing users with dependable compute resources.
- **Tokenized Ownership and Investment**: Collaboration with Berkeley Compute brings tokenized ownership to the GPU space, allowing individuals to invest in GPU clusters and earn passive income, while also enhancing liquidity through secondary markets.
- **Scalable Infrastructure**: Both partnerships enable FarmGPU to offer a scalable solution, supporting everything from small-scale experimental AI projects to large-scale model training and deployment.
- **Decentralized Compute Ecosystem**: Together with our partners, FarmGPU is building a decentralized compute ecosystem that fosters innovation, reduces dependency on centralized providers, and democratizes access to high-performance computing.

FarmGPU's partnerships with RunPod and Berkeley Compute position us as a leader in sustainable, decentralized, and high-performance AI infrastructure. These collaborations are instrumental in delivering the flexibility, cost efficiency, and innovation needed to empower the next generation of AI developers and researchers.
