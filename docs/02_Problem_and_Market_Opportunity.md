# The Problem and Market Opportunity

The global AI revolution has led to an unprecedented demand for GPU compute power, which has exposed significant gaps in the existing infrastructure. Traditional hyperscaler cloud providers such as AWS and Google Cloud don't have robust GPU offerings, rely on vendor lock-in, and don't provide a good experience for AI developers.

## Current Challenges

- **High Costs**: Hyperscaler cloud providers prioritize scalability and reliability but impose high prices, making GPU access unattainable for many smaller players.
- **Centralization of Resources**: The dominance of a few large tech companies in the GPU market creates a barrier to democratizing AI development. This centralization leads to bottlenecks in AI research and development and limits innovation.
- **Limited Flexibility**: Vendor lock-ins, GPU quotas, and limited availability hinder experimentation, especially for smaller organizations that require a more flexible, pay-as-you-go model.

## Market Demand and Opportunity

The increasing demand for compute power comes not only from large-scale AI projects but also from smaller AI initiatives, such as fine-tuning open-source models and running inferencing tasks. The AI landscape has seen a surge in startups and researchers seeking affordable, reliable, and scalable compute power without long-term commitments. Additionally, the trend toward decentralized computing is gaining traction, where the use of DePIN (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks) offers a promising solution to the problems of cost and resource centralization.

FarmGPU aims to bridge this gap by providing cost-effective, high-performance GPU hosting through sustainable practices and leveraging DePIN technologies. By offering tokenized GPU ownership and fractional investment opportunities, FarmGPU is uniquely positioned to democratize access to AI infrastructure, reduce costs, and improve flexibility for users worldwide.
