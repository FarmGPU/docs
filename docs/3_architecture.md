**II. Architectural and Infrastructure Divergence**

The distinct requirements of AI workloads necessitate fundamental differences in data center architecture and physical infrastructure compared to traditional facilities. These differences manifest in physical layouts, power delivery systems, and, most notably, cooling technologies.

**A. Physical Layouts and Facility Design**

Traditional data centers have historically been designed for moderate power densities, typically ranging from 5 to 15 kilowatts per rack (kW/rack).4 Their layouts often prioritize maximizing usable floor space for standard server racks, incorporating considerations for accessibility, general physical security, and tiered reliability levels as defined by standards like the Uptime Institute Tiers (I-IV).14

AI-focused data centers, however, are engineered for extreme power densities. Driven by power-hungry accelerators, rack densities commonly start at 40 kW and can reach 60 kW, 100 kW, or even 120 kW and beyond, as seen with systems like NVIDIA's GB200 NVL72.5 This intense concentration of power means that AI facilities often require less physical floor space *per megawatt (MW)* of IT capacity compared to traditional designs. However, the overall facility design must accommodate the substantial infrastructure needed to deliver this power and, critically, remove the resulting heat. Layouts must integrate specialized cooling equipment, such as liquid distribution manifolds and Coolant Distribution Units (CDUs), directly into or near the rack rows.8 Furthermore, the sheer volume and type of cabling required for high-speed interconnects (both optical fiber and potentially heavy copper for scale-up links like NVLink) influence rack positioning and cable routing pathways.23 The imperative shift is demonstrated by examples like Meta demolishing a data center building under construction because its older, lower-density design was deemed unsuitable for future AI requirements.4 Increasingly, new data center builds, even those initially intended for mixed workloads, are incorporating design flexibility and provisions for future high-density AI deployments, often influenced by modular design principles promoted by the Open Compute Project (OCP).4

**B. Power Infrastructure: Density, Delivery, and Redundancy**

The most striking difference lies in power density. While modern traditional cloud data centers might operate at 15-20 kW/rack, AI systems push this envelope dramatically.8 Average power density for AI is anticipated to increase significantly, potentially from 36 kW/rack in 2023 to 50 kW/rack by 2027, with leading-edge systems far exceeding this.11 This necessitates a fundamental rethinking of electrical infrastructure. AI data centers require exceptionally robust medium-voltage (MV) delivery and low-voltage (LV) distribution systems capable of handling sustained high loads.4 Power utilization rates are also typically much higher for AI training workloads, often exceeding 80%, compared to 50-60% for general cloud workloads or even lower for traditional enterprise applications.4 This sustained demand translates into massive power requirements at the campus level, with individual buildings consuming 40-100 MW and large AI training clusters potentially requiring hundreds of MW, pushing towards gigawatt-scale deployments.4 While traditional data centers often adhere strictly to Uptime Institute Tier standards for redundancy (e.g., 2N for Tier IV), AI facilities might adopt different topologies (potentially N+1 for certain components) to maximize power delivery efficiency, balancing redundancy against the sheer cost and complexity of duplicating such massive power systems.16 A major constraint for AI data center expansion is the capacity of the existing electrical grid, including substations and high-voltage transformers, which often require significant upgrades and long lead times, creating bottlenecks in deployment.
